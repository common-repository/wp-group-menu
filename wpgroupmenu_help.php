                        <p>Thank you for installing this plugin. You are ready to start creating menus.</p>
                        <p>After creating your menus, style your menu bar under settings. More options coming soon.</p>
                        <p>This plugin may be used multiple times on the network / group of websites that you may want to interlink but for
                            convenience I've developed a client version for sister sites that will pull from the main site's menu.</p>
                        <p>This way you manage the menus in one location and all the sister sites reflect your changes automatically. Enjoy!</p>
