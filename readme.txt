== Description ==
This plugin adds a universal top menu among WordPress sister websites.
Administrators may manage menus from one central location (a master site) and use the client plugin (pending) on child sites to display the menus.
Alternately, you may add the master menu to all sites that needs the top menu.
Create as many menus as you like. If you are using the client plugin to display the menus on sisters sites you will need to add that site to the list of menus on the master site.
After creating your menus customize the look under settings and you're all set to go.
